# News Site

This assignment was to create a responsive news site. See the file newssite-sketch.png for a sketch on how the site should look.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started out going through all the information and videos to understand how flexbox and css grid works and what they can do. After that I started adding html content to be able to try css grid and flexbox out with live server so that I could se what my changes in the code did to the web page. I ended up using both css grid and flexbox and I think there are many more ways to use and combine them. If I had more time I would add the animation I started to add, I have commented out the css code because I did not have time to figure out how to make the animation work. My goal was to make the background in the header give the illusion of a wave to match the news sites focus on ocean life.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
